# Palindrome Checker

## Overview
This is a simple JavaScript program that checks if a given text is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter cases.

## How It Works
1. The program asks you to enter text through a prompt.
2. It converts the text to lowercase and removes all non-alphanumeric characters (like spaces and punctuation) .
3. It checks if the filtered string is the same when reversed.
4. The result (`True` or `False`) is shown in the console.
5. You can check multiple strings until you press "Cancel".

## Assumptions
- The program ignores spaces, punctuation, and case differences.
- If you only enter spaces, it will ask for valid input.
- You can exit by pressing "Cancel".

## Example
Input: "Taco cat"
Output: True

Input: "Hello"
Output: False
